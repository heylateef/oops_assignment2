    "Ans:In object-oriented programming, \"self\" is like a special word that helps a class know and talk about itself. When you create objects from a class, \"self\" allows each object to keep track of its own information separately from others. It's used to access and change the object's unique data and actions. This way, each object maintains its identity and behaves differently from others, making the code easier to understand and organize. \"Self\" makes the code more readable by showing that you are working with the current object's properties and actions.\n",
